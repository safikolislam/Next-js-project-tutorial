📰 News Portal Website

A modern News Portal Web Application built using Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and ShadCN UI. This project was developed with the help of YouTube tutorials and AI tools as part of my learning journey in modern web development.

Through this project, I learned how to structure a Next.js application, use the App Router system, and implement dynamic routing. Compared to traditional React Router, the Next.js routing system felt more organized and easier to manage.

The application displays news articles using JSON-based data fetching and allows users to browse articles by category, search by title, and view detailed news pages using dynamic routes.
